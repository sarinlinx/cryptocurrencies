                <p>Mt Gox. The company had already been imposing delays when people tried to withdraw money. Then in early 2014 it simply closed up shop with hundreds of millions of dollars of bitcoin apparently just gone. What we learned from this is that
                    you should control your own coins, and that means not putting it on a remote server, especially one controlled by someone in another country who you have no recourse with.</p>

                <h2>Beware Exchanges</h2>
                <p>don't expect regulation, insurance, or even competence in bitcoin exchanges at this point. You may get those from banks but at the moment there's no regulation that's washing over these other exchanges for bitcoin.</p>

        <h1>Examining Threats</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">
            <div class="col">
                <h2>Types of Threats</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Economic</li>
                    <li>regulatory</li>
                    <li>criminal</li>
                    <li>technological</li>
                    <li>and all those other threats we haven't accounted for yet. </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Economic</h2>
                <p>One criticism of Bitcoin is that it lacks backing in real goods. And that's undeniably the case, that is there's no vault of gold, or canned goods, or water somewhere. That backs up the value of Bitcoin, but that's also largely true of
                    dollars and even gold. When you get right down to it, gold only has value because people say it has value. It doesn't have as much value in real life as say water or food. </p>
                <p>Another economic complaint about bit coin is that it's just a demand bubble. People are just getting into it now because it seems like the thing to get into. And in fact, if you look at its history so far. It's really been very volatile
                    going up and down all the time. But as time goes on, it get more and more support from professional investors, who are putting millions and millions of dollars into it.</p>

                <h2>Regulatory</h2>
                <p> These are most likely to come from governments, but they could also come from powerful non-governmental organizations, such as those backed by the finance industry. There are some who say that governments are able to end Bitcoin if they
                    want to. And the truth is that they control the interface with real money, with dollars, with yen, with euros and so forth, and they can and have closed down exchanges where people exchange Bitcoin for dollars and so forth. On the
                    other hand, governments don't have the power to stop Bitcoin itself. They can't stop people from using it to exchange for goods. And they can't stop people from just using it on their computers. Creating it, exchanging it and so forth.
                    As long as it doesn't go to such things as dollars.</p>
                <p> A second point that people sometimes make. Is that governments have the motivation to end Bitcoin because it undermines national currency controls. But on the other hand, very few countries have actually done that. If you look at a list
                    of such countries, you find that there aren't very many big countries, or those with a lot of economic power. There are notable exceptions of course, such as China. But by and large, countries let money supply, come and go as it pleases,
                    and that includes Bitcoin</p>

                <h2>Technological</h2>
                <p> For this we have to break things down into two categories. First, we have to look at technology that's specific to Bitcoin. Those who fear such losses would point to past events, but if you look more closely at them you'll see that it
                    wasn't Bitcoin technology specifically, that was failing. It was usually something underneath it. It might have been the operating system, or some other part of the security system, or something else but it was not. Bitcoin-specific
                    generally speaking. All right they might say, let's look at those supporting technologies. It doesn't really mater whether it was a Bitcoin specific part of the technology that failed, the end result was that somebody lost money. To
                    that I would counter, that all money has support technology flaws. </p>
                <p> There's millions if not billions of dollars stolen from credit cards every year, based on technology flaws for example. And you could go on and look at other parts of the money system and see similar flaws. The big difference between Bitcoin
                    and those other kinds of money. Is that with those other kinds of money, there is a central authority that you can blame and who will usually make things whole. If money's stolen from your credit card, you go to the credit card company,
                    and they usually cover the loss. That will never happen with Bitcoin, because there is no central authority. Next, let's take a look at the possible threats due to deliberate criminal activity. </p>

                <p><a href="https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/rise-of-the-zombie-bitcoins">https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/rise-of-the-zombie-bitcoins</a>
                    <p>
                        <p>One researcher estimated in 2014 that 30% of all Bitcoin at that point had been lost forever. He calls this lost value zombie Bitcoins. So again, a paper wallet is your best defense. </p>

                        <h2>Criminal</h2>
                        <p> One kind of threat that people often point to with Bitcoin is something called the 51% attack. That is, if an attacker can control 51% of the mining machines on the Bitcoin network, they can basically control the entire Bitcoin
                            money supply. There are good reasons why people won't actually do this. First of all, it'll only be a temporary win. They'll try to make some double spending attacks, that is spend the same money twice using their 51% control
                            of the network, but once this is discovered, there will be other things that come into play, that will be able to shift away from those attackers. </p>
                        <p> Second of all, it's very hard to pull off. You would need an enormous investment or control an enormous network of bots, in order to control the network. Finally, what would the attacker gain? If such an attack were to be successful,
                            the value of Bitcoin would plummet, and so all of the value that the attacker hoped to gain would be lost. Another potential weakness of Bitcoin is that since it's entirely digital and lives on computers, theft can be automated
                            through computers. There are many ways that they could attack, as I say, there's different levels of operating system and security system as well as Bitcoin itself, and the cost to attack isn't very high. </p>
                        <p>The argument against that, is that most money systems nowaday live, more or less, on computers. A big example is the constant attacks against the credit card network, and as we know, people do lose money that way. And that's also
                            done. Through automated computer systems</p>
                        <h2>Other</h2>
                        <p>these are really hard to assess. Bitcoin is so new, we might not have uncovered all of its potential flaws. </p>

        <h1>Protecting your Bitcoin</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">
            <div class="col">
                <p> First, here's the best way to protect Bitcoin for longterm storage using a paper wallet, also known as a cold wallet. The steps are, export your private keys, print them, store them, and restore when needed. The method varies from wallet
                    to wallet. Here's how it works on the Electrum wallet on Android. We first click Receive. And then tap an address. This brings us to our list of addresses. We're only interested in the addresses that have Bitcoin in them, so we tap
                    this All until we come to Funded. Those are two Bitcoin addresses where we've received money. Then we tap an address, and click Details. And Export private key. And then the code you entered when you installed Electrum. You now see
                    your private key. There are many ways you could save it. For example, by taking a screenshot here, or if your wallet allows it, just export the text. But once you do that, remember to print it and store it, because remember, anyone
                    with access to this information can take your Bitcoin. So that's the best way to stay safe, but paper wallets are not very practical if you want to actually use your Bitcoin. </p>


                <p> The solution is to control your coins by storing only a small amount on remote servers. Realize that Bitcoin companies don't have to pass the same tests as a regular bank. So plan ahead of time. Some of those remote sites let you export
                    your private keys to reimport them in a different wallet. Test out those systems before putting a lot of money in them</p>
