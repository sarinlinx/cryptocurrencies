                <h3>Tips from buying and selling through Exchanges</h3>

                <p> First of all, exchanges are perfect if you want to set a price and then wait for someone to meet that price whether you're buying or selling. So, for example, you could say, when the price drops to $300, I want to buy ten bitcoins and
                    then just leave it there. One downside about exchanges is that it's usually hard to get your money in and out of them. That's partly because of restrictions that governments have put in place about money laundering. On the other hand,
                    exchanges have been known to go out of business. So it's best not to leave any more money in them than you can afford to lose. In other words, get your money in, make the exchange and then take it out as quickly as you can. </p>
                <p>Some exchanges offer unusual kinds of trades, such as shorting the currency. If you don't understand these unusual trade types, don't do them. Do only the kinds of trades you understand, or you could end up losing your shirt. Finally,
                    many of these exchanges have what they call a trollbox where people can chat with each other. Be very careful about taking their advice seriously though, because often the people involved have their own motivations for saying what
                    they're saying.</p>


                <p> Like the stock market, exchanges are places that not only match sellers with buyers, but also manage the transfer. You deposit your money or bitcoin, then set an offer to buy or sell at a certain price. Exchanges typically have a dashboard
                    like this one on Bitstamp.net. It shows bitcoin's price over time right here, information about bids that individual buyers have offered, and the asking prices that sellers want, and then down a little bit further, we have a chart
                    of them meeting in the middle. Exchanges are a great place to set future orders, like buy when the price reaches this level and then sell it when it reaches this level, but that means you have to leave either money or bitcoin in the
                    exchange and such exchanges have a bad record of just taking people's money and disappearing. A list of exchanges is at cryptocoincharts.info. Just go over and click exchanges and there's your list. </p>

        <h1>Insitutions</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">
            <div class="col">

                <p>Insitutions sell Bitcoin directly to consumers at a price that they set.</p>
                <p>A big one is <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>.</p>
                <p>Institutions are great for simple buy-in-now orders. In other words, I have money now, I want to buy Bitcoin now as opposed to when it hits a certain price.</p>
                <p>Institutions tend to be easier than exchanges to get your money into and out of but you usually do have to go through some sort of process. However you can set that up in advance and not leave your money with the institution. When you
                    buy or sell through an institution make sure that you're aware of all of their rules because they may have restrictions that are imposed by government bodies. As with exchanges, you don't want to leave too much money in the institutions
                    because if an institution goes out of business holding your money it could take your money with it. </p>

                <p> One of the biggest is coinbase.com which I'm logged into here. It's very straight-forward. You load your bitcoin or money from a bank account or you use a credit card. Then, you say how much you want to buy or sell, and then you check
                    the fees and terms, and then simply click to make it happen. It looks something like this. Go up to buy or sell, scroll down, then say I want to buy $50 of bitcoin. Type in 50 here and it shows me how much I'm buying and then, of course,
                    you just continue the process right here. Institutional sellers are great for buy it or sell it now orders, because the prices and fees are clear. But the same caveats apply as for exchanges. You'll have to setup a payment system.
                    If it's a bank account, expect it to take a few days to get confirmed by the institution. Some exchanges also accept credit cards. The fees can be high on the order of a few percent, so familiarize yourself with all the terms ahead
                    of time and, as with exchanges, don't leave too much money or bitcoin in the accounts when you're not actively trading. Your bank account or paper wallet is safer. </p>

        <h1>Individuals</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">
            <div class="col">
                <p> That is buying and selling between individuals. If you know somebody wants to buy or sell bit coin of course then you're all set. You just deal with that person. If you don't, there are a few places you can go to find such people. One
                    of them is localbitcoins.com. And there are also discussion boards on the bitcoin.org website. When dealing with individuals, I strongly recommend you use only cash or that you barter for something that you want. The reason is. If
                    you accept something like a cheque, you could hand over your Bitcoins and then find that the check's no good. </p>
                <p>When meeting with individuals, security is crucial. Remember, you're meeting somebody who knows that you're carrying something of value and may want to take it from you. Always use a familiar system when you're dealing with individuals.
                    Jewels if they suggest some sort of escrow or some sort of wallet that you've never seen before don't do it it may be a trick. Finally, keep the exchanges simple as possible the more complicated it is the more things can go wrong.
                </p>

                <p> The first hard part is finding someone who wants to make the exchange. If you happen to know someone, that job is done, but there are also online directories that serve as match makers, such as localbitcoins.com where you can find a list
                    of people near you who are willing to make the exchange in person or online. Many areas also have events where bitcoin enthusiasts meet. Meetup.com is one good place to find them. When you sell or buy directly, only accept cash or
                    a valuable, physical object as payment. Checks do bounce and then you're left with nothing. Security is crucial. The person you're meeting knows that you're carrying something of value and may simply rob you. Some police departments
                    will let you execute transactions in the station. Just go in and ask. Always use a familiar system. If they suggest some kind of escrow or other unusual setup, it may be a trick. Finally, wait until the transaction is confirmed by
                    the bitcoin network before considering it done.</p>

        <h1>Other stuff</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">
            <div class="col">
                <p>One site that provides links to a variety of businesses where you can buy and sell Bitcoin is appropriately enough.</p>
                <p>Howtobuybitcoins.info, once there, click on your country or enter your country name to find out who is dealing in Bitcoins in your area.</p>
                <p>When you buy and sell Bitcoin, you absolutely need to check the current situation in your country at the time when you watch this video because several governments have banned or restricted BitCoin business.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory">Legality of bitcoin by country or territory</a></li>

                </ul>
                <p>In particular, those that exchange Bitcoin for national money. Finally, I have to repeat the warnings I gave elsewhere in this course. Whenever you deal in Bitcoin, remember that you're effectively dealing in money.</p>
                <p>Use the same precautions, trust others selectively, and consider your recourse in every situation. </p>

        <h1>Where to spend Bitcoin</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">
            <div class="col">

                <p> there are two big clearinghouses that manage Bitcoin payments for thousands of merchants. One such list of merchants is at bitpay.com/directory. And then you can look through the different categories or just scroll through the list of
                    merchants available.</p>
                <p>Another clearinghouse is at coinbase.com/clients. This is a much shorter list because it doesn't list all of the merchants they have, only the larger ones.</p>

                <p>Then are the independently maintained lists of places that take Bitcoin. One interesting list is this map at coinmap.org. As you zoom in, it shows you in greater detail what these businesses are.</p>
                <p> A second such site is at spendbitcoins.com. And the Bitcoin wiki at bitcoin.it/wiki/trade also has a long list of merchants. </p>

                <h2>Gift cards</h2>
                <p>One thing that really extends where you can spend Bitcoin is when you buy gift cards with it, and then you use those gift cards at thousands of additional merchants, including some really big ones. Two gift card vendors are Gyft, that's
                    spelled GYFT.com and eGifter, EGIFTER.com.</p>

            </div>

        <h1>Sending and receiving bitcoin</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">
            <div class="col">

                <p>First get the recipient address. This is usually represented either by a string of alphanumeric characters, which you'll copy and paste, or as a QR code, which you capture with your device's camera. Then enter all the details. Most important
                    are the amount and the recipient address. You might also add notes to accompany the transaction. These will actually be written into the public block chain, so don't include any secret data. If you're using a wallet that doesn't automatically
                    calculate the transaction fee, you can figure out how much to include by doing a search for Bitcoin transaction fee calculator. Then you confirm all the information and hit send. The Bitcoin should show up in the recipient's account
                    within about 10 minutes, although it could be much longer if your transaction fee wasn't high enough. You can track your transaction's process through the system.</p>


                    <p> Now let's go ahead and send some money. We start by getting the recipient's address. I switch to Electrum, and tap the receive button. Then I tap copy to get the address copied to the clipboard. Then I go back to Coinbase.com. I select accounts and click on my Bitcoin wallet. From here I see the button to send.

Now at the top of the screen you'll see a warning that a minor fee will be added. This is true for all times when you send Bitcoin from one wallet to another. It's not specific to Coinbase or any other online wallet. I'll enter my Bitcoin address by pasting it in, decide on the amount, in this case $20. And you see that it automatically gets converted into the appropriate amount of Bitcoin. And then I'm about to click continue, but I see that it actually won't accept my input.

That's because of something sort of unusual. If we scroll back up we see please enter a valid BTC address. This is a common problem. You see the word Bitcoin at the beginning with the colon. That's because when I copied the address, it didn't just copy the address, but also a request for money to be sent there. All I have to do is delete the word Bitcoin and colon, and then everything should be okay.</p>
