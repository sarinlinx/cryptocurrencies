        <h1>Exchanges</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">
            <div class="col">
<p>there have been a lot of them. And in fact over half that have existed since the beginning of Bitcoin have gone out of business. But the big players is stabilizing, and one site I like that lists them all is cryptocoincharts.info.</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://cryptocoincharts.info/">cryptocoincharts.info/</a></li></ul>
<p>Click on the cryptocurreny you're interested in from the list.</p>
<p>Go to the pair you want to trade (BTC/USD). Click this and you're taken here:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://cryptocoincharts.info/pair/btc/usd">BTC to USD</a></li></ul>
<p>To the right you'll see all of the big players who are trading in Bitcoin, and as we click on any one of them, we can see what the value is on that particular exchange.</p>

<h3>Tips from buying and selling through Exchanges</h3>

<p> First of all, exchanges are perfect if you want to set a price and then wait for someone to meet that price whether you're buying or selling. So, for example, you could say, when the price drops to $300, I want to buy ten bitcoins and then just leave it there. One downside about exchanges is that it's usually hard to get your money in and out of them. That's partly because of restrictions that governments have put in place about money laundering. On the other hand, exchanges have been known to go out of business. So it's best not to leave any more money in them than you can afford to lose. In other words, get your money in, make the exchange and then take it out as quickly as you can. </p>
<p>Some exchanges offer unusual kinds of trades, such as shorting the currency. If you don't understand these unusual trade types, don't do them. Do only the kinds of trades you understand, or you could end up losing your shirt. Finally, many of these exchanges have what they call a trollbox where people can chat with each other. Be very careful about taking their advice seriously though, because often the people involved have their own motivations for saying what they're saying.</p>
          </div></div>


          <h1>Insitutions</h1>
          <div class="row bg-shade">
              <div class="col">

<p>Insitutions sell Bitcoin directly to consumers at a price that they set.</p>
<p>A big one is <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>.</p>
<p>Institutions are great for simple buy-in-now orders. In other words, I have money now, I want to buy Bitcoin now as opposed to when it hits a certain price.</p>
<p>Institutions tend to be easier than exchanges to get your money into and out of but you usually do have to go through some sort of process. However you can set that up in advance and not leave your money with the institution. When you buy or sell through an institution make sure that you're aware of all of their rules because they may have restrictions that are imposed by government bodies. As with exchanges, you don't want to leave too much money in the institutions because if an institution goes out of business holding your money it could take your money with it. </p>

            <h1>Individuals</h1>
            <div class="row bg-shade">
                <div class="col">
<p> That is buying and selling between individuals. If you know somebody wants to buy or sell bit coin of course then you're all set. You just deal with that person. If you don't, there are a few places you can go to find such people. One of them is localbitcoins.com. And there are also discussion boards on the bitcoin.org website. When dealing with individuals, I strongly recommend you use only cash or that you barter for something that you want. The reason is. If you accept something like a cheque, you could hand over your Bitcoins and then find that the check's no good. </p>
<p>When meeting with individuals, security is crucial. Remember, you're meeting somebody who knows that you're carrying something of value and may want to take it from you. Always use a familiar system when you're dealing with individuals. Jewels if they suggest some sort of escrow or some sort of wallet that you've never seen before don't do it it may be a trick. Finally, keep the exchanges simple as possible the more complicated it is the more things can go wrong. </p>

<h1>Other stuff</h1>
<div class="row bg-shade">
    <div class="col">
<p>One site that provides links to a variety of businesses where you can buy and sell Bitcoin is appropriately enough.</p>
<p>Howtobuybitcoins.info, once there, click on your country or enter your country name to find out who is dealing in Bitcoins in your area.</p>
<p>When you buy and sell Bitcoin, you absolutely need to check the current situation in your country at the time when you watch this video because several governments have banned or restricted BitCoin business.</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory">Legality of bitcoin by country or territory</a></li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/9/5395050/russia-bans-bitcoin">Russia bans Bitcoin use</a></li></ul>
<p>In particular, those that exchange Bitcoin for national money. Finally, I have to repeat the warnings I gave elsewhere in this course. Whenever you deal in Bitcoin, remember that you're effectively dealing in money.</p>
<p>Use the same precautions, trust others selectively, and consider your recourse in every situation. </p>
