                <p>Bitcoin was described in a paper on Halloween 2008.</p>

                <p>It is a way to use a cryptographically strengthened public ledger to record and protect transactions.</p>
                <p>The first block of 50 coins is called the 'genesis' block.</p>
                <p>This is a working system where there's a way to release Bitcoins over time, to reward those people who dedicate their computer power to making the system's infrastructure work.</p>

                <p>Bitcoin market price</p>

                </ul>
                <p>In 2010, while Bitcoin was still relatively unknown, <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0">someone paid 10,0000 Bitcoins for a couple of pizzas</a>. If that transaction were to take place as I record this, though, those
                    pizzas would cost over $5 million</p>
                <p>It started to gain popularity and reports were created. Criminals were especially interested in it due to its ease of transfer and semi-anonymous nature.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/05/fbi-fears-bitcoin/">FBI Fears Bitcoin's Popularity with Criminals (Wired.com)</a></li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://betanews.com/2011/10/11/cybercriminals-go-for-easy-money-facebook-and-bitcoin-users/">Cybercriminals go for easy money: Facebook and Bitcoin users</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Soon, legitimate organizations started using Bitcoin.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2012/11/15/pay-another-way-bitcoin/">Pay Another Way: Bitcoin (WordPress)</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Then, services appeared to give people ways to buy, sell, store, learn about and protect their Bitcoins.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://bitpay.com">Get started with blockchain payments (bitpay)</a></li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Buy and sell digital currency (coinbase)</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Then, people in financially unstable countries started using Bitcoin as a way to store their wealth. When the government of Cyprus announced the plan to seize certain bank deposits in April 2013 for example, the price of Bitcoin soared
                    to over $250 before dropping again to settle around 120.</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                <p>As the value of Bitcoin rose, it attracted the attention of government regulators. Although there is no way they can effectively block Bitcoin per say, that hasn't stopped some of them from trying.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.thehindu.com/business/vietnam-bans-bitcoin/article5736019.ece">Vietnam bans bitcoin</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>they can crack down on important parts of its economy, such as exchanges that convert Bitcoin to dollars.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/sen-manchin-demands-complete-us-ban-on-bitcoin/">Sen. Manchin demands complete US ban on Bitcoin</a></li></ul>

                    <p>It also attracted the attention of thieves.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/investors-currency-digital-fund-868/">Bitcoin ponzi scheme â€“ investors lose $5 million USD in online hedge fund</a></li></ul>
                        <p> But although about a half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin have been misappropriated or misplaced, nearly all of that has been because of common business fraud, or incompetence, or bad technical implementations. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/large-bitcoin-exchanges-attacks">Study: 45 percent of Bitcoin exchanges end up closing</a></li></ul>

                            <p>However, no flaws have been found with Bitcoin itslef.</p>
                            <p>hrough all of these things, the hacking attacks, failed Bitcoin businesses, government threats, market changes, Bitcoin has always bounced back.</p>
                            <ul>
