                <p>some coins are designed to have practical use beyond acting as financial tokens. Ethereum's protocol embeds a a complete programming language making it useful for building finance-driven applications.</p>

                <p>What Bitcoin is for money, Ethereum is for well, everything else. It's based on the same technology as Bitcoin in that both use a blockchain to solve two age-old problems. The first is mediating when two events seem to happen at the same
                    time. The blockchain prevents double spending of Bitcoin by only accepting one of those transactions. The blockchain also created a decentralized, unchangeable ledger, so not only do we know who got that Bitcoin, but so does the whole
                    world. Bitcoin implements these innovations without a specific purpose. Yes, it's become valuable in terms of real world money, but the blockchain itself doesn't do anything but mediate events and record transactions. </p>

                <p> Ethereum's blockchain on the other hand, accepts programming instructions called smart contracts, written in a language called Solidity. Any Ethereum user can write a smart contract using Solidity, and put it out on the Ethereum network.
                    This contract is performed by nodes on the Ethereum network, which altogether form the Ethereum virtual network or EVM.</p>

                <p> An application written using smart contract is called a distributed application, or DApp, or most commonly DAPP. The contract's creator pays participants in the Ethereum network to process that application using a crypto-currency called
                    Ether. By the way, people often mistakenly call the crypto-currency Ethereum as well, but officially it's Ether. Such rewards are like transaction fees on the Bitcoin network, which are varied in price enormously and unpredictably.
                    </p>


                <p><a href="http://gavwood.com/paper.pdf" target="_blank">Yellow Paper</a></p>

                <p>Ethereum gets around this problem by using a second internal form of value called Gas to figure out how much you should pay the network. It's a rather complicated relationship, described in details in this so-called yellow paper. In theory
                    this means that the cost of running programs should remain stable, as the layer of Gas counteracts changes in the price of Ether. Now, in reality it's not quite so smooth, but that's a bigger topic.</p>
                    <p>what kinds of programs are being written for the Ethereum virtual network? The official website for Ethereum at Ethereum.org gives a few examples.</p>


                    <p>Certainly study well before you create a smart contract.

Your programming has to be rock solid, because you can't really change a smart contract once it's in motion. In fact, a programming bug let hackers steal about 50 million American dollars of Ether from a venture capital fund. Fortunately, the wallet that's available on Ethereum.org includes options to try out your code first on a test network before any real money is involved. So check and double check your code for smart contracts. </p>
