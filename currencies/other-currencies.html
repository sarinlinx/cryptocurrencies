                <p>After Bitcoin appeared, people tweaked the details in Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin paper and created thousands of other cryptocurrencies. These are sometimes known as alternative coins or alt coins. This list on cryptocoincharts.info is
                    in order of market capitalization which you get by multiplying the number of coins by the value of each coin. The total market capitalization is hundreds of billions of American dollars with quite a few coins having market caps over
                    a billion dollars each. It's extremely easy to create a new cryptocoin. As of early 2018, most are built on top of another cryptocurrency network called Ethereum and are known as tokens. They function a lot like Bitcoin and they're
                    released to the public as initial coin offerings, or ICOs. </p>

                <p> Here's a list of cryptocurrency marketplaces and exchanges in order of descending activity. The numbers in the markets column tell you how many trading pairs each handles. One example of a trading pair is dollars to Bitcoin. A less common
                    one might be Ether to Iota. Click on any exchange name to see which cryptocurrencies and tokens they trade in. If you compare them, you'll see that only about a half dozen cryptocurrencies are widely traded at any given time. That's
                    how other cryptocurrencies compare with Bitcoin in market terms, but there are other differences as well. Bitcoin uses something called proof of work to secure the system where miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles. </p>
