        <h1>Market Capitalizations</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">

                <p>After Bitcoin appeared, people tweaked the details in Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin paper and created thousands of other cryptocurrencies. These are sometimes known as alternative coins or alt coins. This list on cryptocoincharts.info is
                    in order of market capitalization which you get by multiplying the number of coins by the value of each coin. The total market capitalization is hundreds of billions of American dollars with quite a few coins having market caps over
                    a billion dollars each. It's extremely easy to create a new cryptocoin. As of early 2018, most are built on top of another cryptocurrency network called Ethereum and are known as tokens. They function a lot like Bitcoin and they're
                    released to the public as initial coin offerings, or ICOs. </p>

                <p><a href="https://cryptocoincharts.info/markets/info">https://cryptocoincharts.info/markets/info</a></p>
                <p> Here's a list of cryptocurrency marketplaces and exchanges in order of descending activity. The numbers in the markets column tell you how many trading pairs each handles. One example of a trading pair is dollars to Bitcoin. A less common
                    one might be Ether to Iota. Click on any exchange name to see which cryptocurrencies and tokens they trade in. If you compare them, you'll see that only about a half dozen cryptocurrencies are widely traded at any given time. That's
                    how other cryptocurrencies compare with Bitcoin in market terms, but there are other differences as well. Bitcoin uses something called proof of work to secure the system where miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles. </p>

        <h1>Comparing other cryptocurrencies with Bitcoin</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">
            <div class="col">
                <p>First is ease of use. Are there places you can spend it? Can it be converted easily into your national currency? </p>

                <p>Second is the cryptocurrency's utility. If you're a gamer, for example, you might be especially interested in a cryptocoin that also functions as currency in the virtual world of your favorite games. Some initial coin offerings promise
                    other benefits that are similar to stock ownership in a company that issued them. </p>

                <p> Third is the market capitalization. This is a sign of popular support which could lead to an economy growing around that coin. Fourth is the technology behind the coin. Is it secure? How quickly are transactions processed? Can it scale
                    for future growth? </p>

                <p> Finally, we have an unusual criterion, a coin's origin story. Who started it? Why? How easy is it to find out who exactly they are? What were their reputations before they created their coin? Also look at how many coins are pre-mined,
                    which means that the founders grabbed some coins before the public release. </p>

        <h1>Ripple for finance</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">
            <div class="col">
<h2>Overview of the financial system</h2>
<p>The ability to transfer money was originally one of Bitcoin's target uses. But at times, it's not been very practical for that purpose. Sometimes transactions are too slow, the fees are too high, and the Bitcoin network is overcrowded. Financial institutions are responsible for most of the money transfer in the world. And they also have other needs that can't be met by Bitcoin. For example, they have to follow laws that are designed to protect against fraud and other criminal activity. One example is the know your customer laws of the United States and several other countries.

They need to perform a lot of transactions. The Visa payment network handles 50,000 transactions per second, and that's just one company. By contrast, the Bitcoin network handles fewer than 10 transactions per second. Ripple, which I'll describe in a minute, handles about 1,500 per second, and it's designed to grow. Financial institutions often have to transact in multiple currencies. Although the Ripple system has its own cryptocurrency, known as the ripple and traded under the symbol XRP, it's also designed to be used as a place keeper for any other asset, Euros, Bitcoin, bars of gold, whatever.

Finally, financial institutions have their own highly-secure, proprietary computer systems. Some of those systems are decades old. They need to be integrated with any proposed solution.</p>

<h2>Ripple</h2>
<p><a href="https://ripple.com" target="_blank">ripple.com</a></p>
<p>Ripple was created in 2012 to meet such needs. It was actually based on a system that was designed way back in 2004, long before the Bitcoin paper was published. Some of Ripple's biggest differences from Bitcoin include that all of its coins, all 100 billion of them, were pre-mined, that is, they were created before the system became public.

Now 20% of these were held by Ripple's creators, who are now incorporated as a private company named Ripple Labs. This has been something of a point of controversy in the community. Participants in the Ripple economy can name partners whom they trust well enough for direct transactions, which removes friction between them. Ripple has something of a hierarchy that doesn't exist in Bitcoin, with established parties controlling gateways and acting as market makers. Finally, the network is secured by verifications among these trusting parties, rather than by Bitcoin's system of mining. </p>

<p> But perhaps the biggest difference between Ripple and Bitcoin, and its biggest accomplishment, is that an impressive number of major institutions have bought into it, driven in part by efforts by Ripple Labs to make Ripple work with their existing systems and specific needs. So, is Ripple right for you? Well, as I'm recording this video, it's one of the top cryptocurrencies. And given that much of it is held by institutions like banks, it has quite a bit of support for future developments.

On the other hand, its use by an individual is fairly limited. But quite a few exchanges will convert it into national currencies, and its transaction fees are essentially zero. Its practical utility is high, but again, mostly only for big financial institutions with high trading volumes. Its technology is pretty impressive, with transactions settling in seconds, instead of Bitcoin's minutes or hours. Now having said that, it's not as well-tested as Bitcoin's proof-of-work blockchain, and as I mentioned, 20% of the currency was originally held back by the company.

Most of that has been put into time-locked escrow, to prevent a sell-off that would disrupt the Ripple economy. But that's still a lot of power to put in anyone's hands. While Bitcoin was intended for everybody, Ripple is a sort of hidden mover in the cryptocurrency world with little interface for the ordinary individual. But as a potential driver of tomorrow's banking systems, it could become increasingly important. </p>

        <h1>IOTA for the Internet of Things</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">
            <div class="col">
<p><a href="https://www.iota.org/" target="_blank">iota.org</a></p>
<p>A crypto currency called IOTA promises to give order to this wealth of Internet of Things data. In fact, the IOT in IOTA stands for Internet of Things.

A big part of this is the IOTA data marketplace launched in late 2017. The idea is that anybody who owns the data coming from those devices will be able to sell it to those who want it.</p>

<p>Here's an example. Let's say that you buy a carton of milk and bring it home to your house. Your refrigerator can tell when the milk's about to pass its expiration date because it's able to read RFID chips like the one embedded in the carton of milk that you bought. More over, your fridge is connected to the internet so it could even send you a message when the milk's gone bad.

But that information might also be of use to the dairy which could perhaps offer smaller sizes in places where people that the milk go bad more often. Or maybe a university researcher or government agency wants to know about dairy consumption. So out on the internet, these parties are seeking Internet of Things information about milk going bad. They see that you have such information and since you've previously given permission for it to be sold, you provided in exchange for a tiny payment, what they call a micropayment. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.iota.org/iota-data-marketplace-cb6be463ac7f" target="_blank">IOTA Data Marketplace</a></p>
<p> The IOTA foundation's website at IOTA.org has some much better ones. They also suggest that IOTA is right for buying and selling not just data, but also resources like energy and computing power. Or as they put it, everything as a service. They've gotten buy-in from some impressive partners including Microsoft and Fujitsu. So that example of the fridge really could happen.</p>

<p> IOTA has some unusual features that make it very different from Bitcoin. First, it doesn't use a traditional blockchain. Instead, it uses a data structure called The Tangle. Each transaction confirms two previous ones so there's no separate group of miners. Instead, everybody does just a little to keep the ledger secure. Second, there are no transaction fees and the network has theoretically unlimited scaling, although its scalability hasn't really wildly been tested yet.

A huge 2.8 quadrillion coins were released when IOTA was created. This was done to keep the value of each coin low so it's easy to pay someone a thousandth of a penny. As a result, IOTA are discussed in terms of million of units or MegaIota. It's usually written MIOTA on the markets. Finally, a technical peculiarity. The system uses ternary math instead of binary math. That will only affect you if you're developing for the system and you can get details in the white paper that describes all of the specifics.

IOTA is a good example of a purpose built cryptocurrency. It's backed by some powerful players and it has an ambitious goal.</p>

            <h1>ICOs - Initial Coin Offerings</h1>
            <div class="row bg-shade">
                <div class="col">
<p>An ICO is the first release of a cryptocurrency. Technically, most ICOs are so-called tokens on Ethereum's blockchain. But for most purposes, they behave just like a cryptocurrency. </p>
<p> Because most ICOs are built on Ethereum, their creators can take advantage of Ethereum's programming language, Solidity. On that note, these coins can be tied to items of real value. A digital storage company might release coins that can later be redeemed for a certain amount of disc space, for example. These are known as utility tokens. There are also asset tokens, which give the holder partial ownership of some asset, such as a piece of real estate.</p>

<p>ICOs are often used to raise funds from many people, or crowdfunding, as it's often called. A lot of websites track ICOs, providing links so you can learn more.,</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptocoincharts.info/ico" target="_blank">cryptocoincharts.info/ico</a></p>
<p>Some also attempt to rate the risk and hype level of ICOs</p>

<p><a href="https://icorating.com/" target="_blank">icorating.com</a></p>


<p>I'd personally be somewhat wary of those ratings. Most of these sites sell ad space to ICOs, giving paid listings priority at the top of the page.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.icohotlist.com/" target="_blank">icohotlist.com</a></p>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<p> Promoters can say anything they want about future benefits or company assets, but there's little way to prove any of that, and there's almost no government regulation or enforcement. Anyone can buy into an ICO, even if they have no idea what they're doing. There is no qualification process. So the amount of money raised is often way out of line for the value offered. That's why some countries are cracking down on ICOs. The Wikipedia page for initial coin offering has been doing a good job of summarizing regulations, with an extensive table showing what's happening in various parts of the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering#Regulation" target="_blank">Regulation</a></p>

Finally, scammers have been actively trying to hijack ICOs by using misinformation. When the messaging company Telegram started talking about an ICO but before they actually released it, scammers placed this ad on Facebook to collect money for the nonexistent cryptocurrency. </p>
<p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-to-make-of-leaked-telegram-ico-white-paper" target="_blank">What to Make of ‘Leaked’ Telegram ICO White Paper</a></p>

<h2>Judging if an ICO is worthwhile</h2>
<p> First, approach the ICO like any other investment, because that's what it is. What's its profit potential? How will it get there? Why do you think that? Who's involved, and what have they accomplished before, and so on.

Make sure you understand how it will work, in particular, the timeline for releasing coins and how they'll be used and traded. If the promoters promise an asset or utility, look into how you'll actually be able to claim it. Is it written into the ICO's code? Or is it just someone making a promise? Finally, check and double-check that you're actually dealing with the real thing, because look-alikes abound. ICOs have tremendous potential for connecting investors with opportunities, but they also have tremendous potential for fraud.

At the moment, they're still a very high-risk proposition, so step carefully. </p>
