                <p>Bitcoin was described in a paper on Halloween 2008.</p>

        <h1>Rise of Bitcoin</h1>

                </ul>
                <p>In 2010, while Bitcoin was still relatively unknown, <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0">someone paid 10,0000 Bitcoins for a couple of pizzas</a>. If that transaction were to take place as I record this, though, those
                    pizzas would cost over $5 million</p>
                <p>It started to gain popularity and reports were created. Criminals were especially interested in it due to its ease of transfer and semi-anonymous nature.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/05/fbi-fears-bitcoin/">FBI Fears Bitcoin's Popularity with Criminals (Wired.com)</a></li>

                </ul>
                <p>Soon, legitimate organizations started using Bitcoin.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2012/11/15/pay-another-way-bitcoin/">Pay Another Way: Bitcoin (WordPress)</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Then, services appeared to give people ways to buy, sell, store, learn about and protect their Bitcoins.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://bitpay.com">Get started with blockchain payments (bitpay)</a></li>

                </ul>
                <p>Then, people in financially unstable countries started using Bitcoin as a way to store their wealth. When the government of Cyprus announced the plan to seize certain bank deposits in April 2013 for example, the price of Bitcoin soared
                    to over $250 before dropping again to settle around 120.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>As the value of Bitcoin rose, it attracted the attention of government regulators. Although there is no way they can effectively block Bitcoin per say, that hasn't stopped some of them from trying.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.thehindu.com/business/vietnam-bans-bitcoin/article5736019.ece">Vietnam bans bitcoin</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>they can crack down on important parts of its economy, such as exchanges that convert Bitcoin to dollars.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/sen-manchin-demands-complete-us-ban-on-bitcoin/">Sen. Manchin demands complete US ban on Bitcoin</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>It also attracted the attention of thieves.</p>

                </ul>
                <p> But although about a half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin have been misappropriated or misplaced, nearly all of that has been because of common business fraud, or incompetence, or bad technical implementations. </p>

                </ul>

                <p>However, no flaws have been found with Bitcoin itslef.</p>
                <p>hrough all of these things, the hacking attacks, failed Bitcoin businesses, government threats, market changes, Bitcoin has always bounced back.</p>

        <h1>Comparing Bitcoin to other currencies</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">
            <div class="col">
<img src="../../img/currency-comparison.png"/>
<p>We'll start with Bitcoin. In form, it's a purely digital currency. It doesn't exist in any other place.</p>
<p>As such, it's completely online ready. As described earlier, it uses an online network rather than a central authority in order to oversee it. When you spend Bitcoin, it is absolutely spent. There is no way to get it back except to go to the courts and demand it back that way. Finally, the cost of use for Bitcoin is very low compared to other forms of value. Now let's look at cash. It's form is purely physical and as such it is not in any way online ready. The authority is whatever government backs the cash, whether it's the United States or Britain or anywhere else.</p>
<p>When you spend it, you have no recourse except, again, go to the courts and it's cost of use is actually very low. Moving on to checks, these are mostly physical, although that is moving around somewhat, in that you can now take pictures of checks and deposit them that way. As such, they're a little bit online-ready, but mostly they're a physical form. The authority comes from the bank that issues them, and you do have recourse by going to that bank. The cost of use is moderate, that is, you have to spend a certain amount in fees and overdraft protection and so forth in order to make the checking system work.</p>
<p>Then we come to credit cards. At this point, credit cards are mostly digital, and you can use them online quite well. The authority, once again, is the bank that issues them, and if you want to get your money back, you do still have recourse through the bank. The cost of use, however, is very high, because the bank is guaranteeing the value until the transaction closes, which can be weeks or months later.</p>
            </div>

        <h1>2017 update to section above</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">
            <div class="col">
        <img src="../../img/currency-comparison2.png"/>
        <p>Bitcoin. In form, it's a purely digital currency. It doesn't exist in another place and so it's completely online ready.</p>
<p>Its authority comes from an online network of individual players, there is no central authority. When you spend Bitcoin, it is absolutely spent. There's no way to get it back. Finally, the cost of use for Bitcoin used to be very low, typically only a few pennies per transaction. But as the Bitcoin network has become overcrowded, transaction fees went way up in late 2017. Technical measures to lower them are being attempted as I record this, but it's unclear how successful they'll be in the long run.</p>

<p>So that's Bitcoin. Now let's jump in our time machine and go back to the very first form of money, barter, or trading one thing for another. Gold falls in this category because you have to physically exchange it for whatever you're getting. In barter, you have to bring a physical object from one place to another, as such, it is not in any way online ready. The only authority when you barter is physical proof, that is, seeing and probing the object. There's no central authority guaranteeing its value.</p>

<p>Once you've made the exchange, there's no recourse, and the cost of use is actually very high because of the cost to carry and secure the physical objects. Eventually, cash came to stand in as tokens for those unwieldy physical objects. Now cash is also purely physical, so it doesn't really work online. The authority is whatever government backs the cash, whether it's the United States, or Zimbabwe, or anywhere else. When you spend cash, you have no recourse, it's just gone. Finally, its cost of use is actually pretty low.</p>

  <img src="../../img/currency-comparison2.png"/>
  <p> Moving forward in time, we come to checks. These are mostly physical, although that is changing somewhat, in that you can now take pictures of checks and deposit them digitally in that way. As such, they're a little bit online ready, but mostly they're a physical form. The authority comes from whatever bank issued them and you do have recourse by going to that bank. The cost of use for checks is moderate. That is, you have to spend a certain amount in fees and overdraft protection and so forth in order to make the checking system work.</p>

<p>Plus of course, you have to have the money on reserve at the bank. Finally, we come to that most modern invention, credit cards. At this point, credit cards are mostly digital and you can use them online quite well. As with checks, the authority is the bank that issues them, which can give us recourse if you want your money back. The cost of use however, is very high, because the bank is guaranteeing the value until the transaction closes, which can be weeks or even months later. </p>
