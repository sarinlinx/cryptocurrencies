        <h1>Mining</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">
            <div class="col">
                <p>transactions on the Bitcoin network get confirmed by computers that compete to solve cryptographic puzzles. This process is called mining, because whoever solves the problem gets a reward. It's sort of like digging into the earth to get
                    gold. Now, you might be asking, who are these miners, and how can I claim some of those rewards? I'm sorry to say that mining is now such a competitive activity that individuals have very little chance of doing well in it, unless they're
                    willing to invest a lot to get machinery and expertise.</p>
                <p>All the places you'd go to learn about Bitcoin also have areas where people talk specifically about mining, and a good place to find them all is on bitcoin.org. Just go to Resources, and click Community, then go to the Forums</p>
                <p>There are also some good calculators for miners. I like the one at TradeBlock. Just go to the site of tradeblock.com and click Mining. One thing I like about this site is that it has a calculator that'll show you how long it will take
                    you make back your money after you buy your equipment. </p>

                <p> One important thing to note for each piece of hardware is the hash rate. It's measured in gigahashes per second. A gigahash is a billion calculations that the computer runs through for every second, and in this case, it runs through about
                    336 million calculations per second. One thing that that makes absolutely clear, is that an ordinary computer, like the one on your desk, has virtually no chance of competing. If you just use the CPU or central processing unit you'd
                    be lucky to get about one tenth of a gigahash per second. Some of the mining hardware available today gets thousands of gigahashes per second. </p>

                    <p>And the thing is, it's an all or nothing situation. You only get a block reward if you're the first to solve the entire block. So, small players usually get nothing. That's why miners band together in mining pools. They split up the problem, solve it cooperatively to win the race, and then divide the reward. This page at blockchain.info/pools shows you which mining pools are getting the most block rewards.</p>


<h2>Power</h2>
<p>The network is enormously wasteful. Miners worldwide consume enough energy to power millions of homes. Differences in energy prices could consolidate mining power in the hands of those with access to cheap power.</p>

<h2>Profit</h2>
<p>miners are struggling to make any money on Bitcoin. It's common to spend thousands of dollars on equipment, only to see it become obsolete before you can even turn a profit.</p>


<p>Transactions on the Bitcoin network get confirmed by computers that compete to solve cryptographic puzzles in a process called mining. Now, you might be asking, who are these miners and how can I claim some of those rewards? Well, I'm sorry to say that mining is now such a competitive activity that individuals have very little chance of doing well in it. Here's why. The system is designed to let one block be mined every 10 minutes or so, regardless of how much computing power competes to solve that block.

Total computing power is measured in hashes and you can see how it's gone up in the two years before I recorded this video. By the way, you can't mine Bitcoin anymore on an ordinary phone or computer. Dedicated mining hardware is up to a million times faster. Second, manufacturers keep releasing faster equipment, so you have just a small window of time to earn back the money you spent for your mining rig before you're outdone by miners with newer equipment.

Generally speaking, who can mine Bitcoin profitably? The people with the cheapest electricity. Unless you live in China or a handful of other countries, that person is probably not you</p>
<a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/china/">How much does electricity cost?</a></p>

<p>But if you still want to give it a go, I'd recommend seeking out advice from within the community. <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/">The mining forum on bitcointalk.org is probably the most active place for such discussions</a>. As usual, the knowledge and intelligence levels vary tremendously, so don't take anything as absolute truth.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/hardware/">various how-tos around the web</a>. Just search for Bitcoin mining. I rather like this one I found at buybitcoinworldwide.com.</p>
<p>As for which hardware to buy, <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison">bitcoin.it has a nice comparison</a>, although I can't say how well it's updated. Now, that's important because Bitcoin mining is an arms race, so you really need the latest information.</p>
<p>While you're shopping, you'll need to get used to some abbreviations. MHash means megahash. This is a measure of how many millions of calculations the mining equipment can perform per second in its goal to solve a block's cryptographic puzzle and claim its prize. A gigahash is thousand megahashes and a terahash is a thousand gighashes.</p>
<p>The big question before you plunk down money on a sweet, new mining rig is whether it'll be profitable. Fortunately, there are some wonderful calculators for that online. One that I really like is at tradeblock.com.</p>
<p><a href="https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/mining/">tradeblock.com/bitcoin/mining</a></p>
<p>Enter some base figures to see how much money you could make. Scroll down to the market and hardware parameters here. The hash rate of the piece of equipment I'm interested in, 24,000 gigahashes per second. It takes about 1,375 watts and it costs about $3,000. Let's say that shipping is about $100 and the miscellaneous costs are also about $100. I'll leave everything the same, including the cost of electricity, this last thing here, which is the most important part, 15 cents per kilowatt hour. Hit calculate.</p.
  <p>As you can see in that first year, we're not going to hit profitability. We will have lost about $1,500. Now, let's change that to say seven cents. Hit calculate, we're almost there, but if we could get electricity for four cents a kilowatt hour, (giggling) we're still not there.</p>
<p>As you can see, you really have to compete on price for electricity in order to win this game.</p>
<p>After you get your equipment, you'll almost certainly want to join a mining pool. The thing is mining is an all or nothing situation. You only get a block reward if you're the first to solve the entire block. If you work on your own, chances are you will never solve a block and so you get nothing, but by pooling resources, miners as a group solve blocks frequently and then split up the rewards so they get a steady and more reliable stream of income.</p>
<p>This chart on blockchain.info shows who has the biggest pools at the moment. The bigger the pool, the more steady the income. Each has a website with instructions on how to join. By the way, some companies have advertised Bitcoin mining, quote, "In the cloud," basically where you rent time on their equipment. Now, I've never heard of anybody making money this way and a lot of the companies running those ads have been frauds in the past, but times change so it might be worth researching by the time you watch this.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining is a nearly perfect, mathematically controlled, zero-sum game with millions of players around the world, so there's really no way to trick the system. But approached soberly and intelligently, it is possible to profit just a little from mining Bitcoin.</p>
