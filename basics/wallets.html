                <p>First, you need a wallet. This is usually software for your computer or portable device that contains your public key. That is the full form of the address where people can send Bitcoins to you along with your private key which gives you
                    access to those Bitcoins.</p>
                <p> you can't easily get wallets for iOS device because Apple has blocked their distribution through the Apple app store.</p>

        <h1>3 Types of wallets</h1>
        <div class="row bg-shade">
            <div class="col">
                <p>There are basically <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet">3 types of wallets</a></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Desktop</li>
                    <li>Mobile</li>
                    <li>Web - Tend to be less secure</li>
                </ul>
<p>A wallet is very much like a bank account, except that you can create as many as you want. And in fact, some people create different wallets for different purposes: such as personal and business or even one wallet for each transaction that they do. </li>
<p>On an Android phone, just visit the Play store and search for Bitcoin wallet.</li>
  <p>Any of these wallets will work, and you can always change which one you use. Simply install the new wallet and send your Bitcoins to yourself at the new address.</p>

        </div>

<h1>Warning</h1>
<div class="row bg-shade">
    <div class="col">
<p> One warning though, be sure to check the URL of the site where you're downloading the wallet. Your best bet is to only download wallets by way of links that come from bitcoin.org and specifically from this page at /chooseyourwallet.</p>
<p> Also consider storing only a small amount of money in the new wallet for awhile because it's possible that a scammer could release new wallet software that quietly steals your coin. And remember that anyone who has access to your device also has access to your wallet and can spend your coins. So, treat your Bitcoin wallet like a real world wallet because it contains real world money. </p>
