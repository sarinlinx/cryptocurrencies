                <h2>Block Explorer</h2>
                <p>The easiest way to look at the block chain is with something called a block explorer. There are several of them out there. When searching be sure that it's the explorer for Bitcoin and not one of the other crypto currencies like light
                    coin or anon coin.</p>

                <h2>https://blockchain.info/</h2>
                <p>Here you see the most recently confirmed block. And if you click on any of them you can see the transactions that occur within that block. You can also see the details of any specific transaction. Going down the page, you see all of the
                    transactions going through the block chain. Now remember, this is pretty much all of the transactions happening in Bitcoin in the world. And if you click on any one of these. You can see it in bitcoin as opposed to dollars. Some wallets
                    including multi bit which we're using, link directly to transactions that you've done.</p>

                <h2>Viewing from your wallet</h2>
                <p> Some wallets including multi bit which we're using, link directly to transactions that you've done. You just highlight the transaction, say show transaction details. And then view it blockchain.info or at blockexplorer.com. That launches
                    a browser and shows us our transaction. </p>


        <h2>Viewing the world's information</h2>

                <p> Remember, the record of the entire world's transactions is public, so we can actually use a block explorer to see how much money is connected with any individual address, including our own. So I'll switch to MultiBit and then close out
                    this window we opened earlier. And switch to request that shows us our address. This button here copies it to the clipboard. Then go back to block chain and paste it into the search bar. And there's our address and it says exactly
                    how much money we have</p>

<p>                    Blockchain.info has some other interesting tools, which you can see by going back to the home page and then scrolling to the bottom. For example, you can see who the biggest miners are on the bitcoin network by clicking Mining Pool Stats</p>
